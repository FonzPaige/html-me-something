            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>My family and close group of friends are by far the most important things in life to me. 
              My immediate family includes my Mom, Dad, 2 older sisters, 4 nieces, and 1 nephew. I've yet
              to have children of my own, but I definitely plan on having a few in the future. My second family 
              includes 6 very close friends whom I consider my brothers, and my beautiful girlfriend Ari. Without this 
              amazing group of people, I couldn't even tell you where I would be in life right now. I live for them, and 
              they live for me.             
           </p>

            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>Food? Don't even get me started on Food! Without food, there is no me. Literally, I'd perish from malnutrition. 
              But on a lighter note, food makes me so damn happy :). My favorite foods are chicken wings, pepperoni pizza, potato chips, 
              pasta, and weirdly enough, asparagus and many other vegetables. I love trying new recipes when I'm cooking, and visiting mom and 
              pop restaraunts when i dine out. I'm all for trying anything once, but if I don't like something, I'll never even think about it again. 
              Though my love for food is insanely high, I still try to eat a balanced diet in order to remain healthy. Food feeds the body, and the soul, so it's
              imperative to be conscious of what you put in your body.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music is yet another thing that keeps my spirits high about life. I really appreciate music, and the effort artist make to produce high quality sounds. My 
              favorite genres of music are Hip-Hop and R&B, and a few of my favorite artists in rotation at the moment are Jim Jones, Wiz Khalifa, Jhene Aiko, 
              A Boogie, Nipsey Hussle, Mac Miller, H.e.r, and Melii. My favorite artist of all time is Jay-Z; I know, typical. Though hip-hop and R&B are the main genres I listen to, 
              I make an effort to venture and listen to music outside of the norm. I'm always amazed at the different sounds and vibes that can be produced.

            <h2>Cars</h2>
            <p>Cars are what keep me pushing to be successful. I'm really into cars and one day plan to have a stable filled with antique and newer models of all body types, and performances. I currently drive
              a Camaro, and I'm looking to buy an SUV for my next purchase. Cars are the ultimate status symbols, but even deeper than that I love the way they sound, I love how off-roaders can take you
              through mountain terrain, and how sports cars can get you from point A to point B rather quickly. In order to fullfill my boyish dreams of owning a garage filled with everthing from lamborghini's, to Chevy Bel-Air's,  
              I have to make smart investments/decisions, and work hard to put myself in a wealthy position. The visualization of me behind the wheel of such cars keep me pushing for everything I want in life.
